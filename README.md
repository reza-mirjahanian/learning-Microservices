### Key Benefits
The benefits of microservices are many and varied. Many of these benefits can be laid at
the door of any distributed system. 

### What About Service-Oriented Architecture?
(SOA) is a design approach where multiple services
collaborate to provide some end set of capabilities. A service here typically means a
completely separate operating system process.

###Governance
Governance ensures that enterprise objectives are achieved by evaluating stakeholder
needs, conditions and options; setting direction through prioritisation and decision
making; and monitoring performance, compliance and progress against agreed-on
direction and objectives.

###What makes a good service?
loose coupling and high cohesion

###Onion Architecture
Onion Architecture is based on the inversion of control principle. Onion Architecture is comprised of multiple concentric layers interfacing each other towards the core that represents the domain. The architecture does not depend on the data layer as in classic multi-tier architectures, but on the actual domain models.

###Remote Procedure Calls
Remote procedure call refers to the technique of making a local call and having it execute
on a remote service somewhere
Many of these technologies are binary in nature, like Java RMI, Thrift, or protocol buffers,
while SOAP uses XML for its message formats. Some implementations are tied to a
specific networking protocol
